A mother is the most precious person in life. We cannot describe completely in words. However, some of the valuable moments with our mother can be described. A mother is the most beautiful and caring person in our lives. She always cares every moment for our every need without her any personal intention. In the morning, she calls us very softly to get rise from the bed and during night she tell us lovely stories to make us sleep with a beautiful dream.
