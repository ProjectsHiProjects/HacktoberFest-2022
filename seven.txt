We live on the most beautiful planet, Earth, which has very clean and attractive nature full of greenery. Nature is our best friend which provides us all the resources to live here. It gives us water to drink, pure air to breathe, food to eat, land to stay, animals, plants for our other uses, etc for our betterment. We should fully enjoy the nature without disturbing its ecological balance. We should take care of nature, make it peaceful, keep it clean and prevent it from the destruction so that we can enjoy nature forever. Nature is a most precious gift given by the God to us to enjoy so we should maintain it.
